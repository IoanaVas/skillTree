Demo JS  skills

## Polifills
On `polifill` branch

## Transpiller
On `no-transpiller-server` branch I implemented a basic node server using `express`.
We want to use some of the modern JS features, such as `import * from ...` instead of require.
On `babel-transpiller`, installing some babel packages and configuring the `.babelrc` file , I could use the `import` feature of JS.
